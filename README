This is a simple MUD, in LPMud style. Or at least, feeling nostalgic about
LPMuds started me writing it. It targets App Engine as a backend, uses XMPP
(aka google chat) to connect, and you should be able to just clone the
repository, create app.yaml from sample-app.yaml with a changed application
name, and upload to App Engine to be up and running (or use the dev_appserver 
on your own machine, obviously).
